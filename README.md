# Octoprint Gcode Thumbs

Enriches the file list with a preview thumbnail for each gcode file.

## Use at your own risk
This plugin uses some hack to what is otherwise impossible via the official API. This means that upgrading Octoprint or using other plugins will lead to all sorts of issues.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
